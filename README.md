**Challenge Name:** Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table

<hr>

## Workflow

1.	Data Exploration
    - Univariate Analysis
    - Correlation Graph
2.	Pre-processing/Feature Engineering
3.	Algorithm Implementation
    -	Model training and parameter tuning using GridSearchCV 
      - With train-test split
      - With k-fold cross validation
4.	With the trained model, predict the accuracy on the test data 


## Algorithms Implemented

**Justification of selecting supervised machine learning algorithms** <br>
By exploring the datasets, we observe that for each instance, a label is provided. When data with label is provided, supervised machine learning algorithms can be applied.<br>
Following five algorithms are used in model creation for Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table dataset<br>
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	Support Vector Machine
3.	Adaboosting
4.	Neural Net
5.	Random Forest
